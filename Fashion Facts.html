  <h2> Fashion Facts </h2>
  <ul
  <li>The fashion industry has a disastrous impact on the environment. In fact, it is the second largest polluter in the world, just after the oil industry. And the environmental damage is increasing as the industry grows.</li>
  <li>It takes an average of 7,000 litres of water to produce one pair of jeans. That's about the amount of water you drink over the course of 5-6 years.</li>
  <li>In most of the countries in which garments are produced, untreated toxic wastewaters from textiles factories are dumped directly into the rivers.</li>
  <li>Wastewater contains toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others. These are extremely harmful for the aquatic life and the health of the millions people living by those rivers banks. The contamination also reaches the sea and eventually spreads around the globe.</li>
  <li>Another major source of water contamination is the use of fertilizers for cotton production, which heavily pollutes runoff waters and evaporation waters.</li>
  <li>Greenpeace estimates 20% of clothing not to be worn once</li>
  <li>Everytime we wash a synthetic garmets over 1900 microfibres are released into the water and find their way into the ocean</li>
  <li>85% of human made debris on the shorelines around the world are mircofibres</li>
</ul>
